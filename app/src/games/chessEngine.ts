/*
 * LOCAL FORK OF chess.js 1.4.0
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file is a copy of chess.js/src/chess.ts, modified so a single engine
 * covers three variants. The copies under `backend-js/src/game/gamestate/games/`
 * and `app/src/games/` must stay byte-identical (`npm run sync:chess-engine`)
 * so the client and the server agree about legality down to the last edge case.
 *
 * Differences from upstream:
 *
 * 1. `variant` constructor option: 'standard' | 'chess960' | 'fog'.
 *
 * 2. Castling is generalised. Upstream hardcodes e1/e8 kings and a1/h1/a8/h8
 *    rooks; this fork tracks the castling rook squares per colour, accepts
 *    Shredder-FEN castling fields (file letters) as well as KQkq, and moves the
 *    king to the g/c file and the rook to the f/d file wherever they started.
 *    Chess960 castle moves are encoded king-takes-rook internally (the only
 *    unambiguous encoding when the king's destination may hold the rook), while
 *    standard chess keeps upstream's king-moves-two-squares encoding so games
 *    recorded before this fork still replay identically.
 *
 * 3. `chess960Fen()` generates any of the 960 Chess960 starting positions using
 *    the standard Scharnagl numbering.
 *
 * 4. Fog of war. `visibleSquares(color)` computes exactly what a player can
 *    see and `fogFen(color)` renders a FEN with everything else erased. In the
 *    fog variant there is no check, no checkmate and no pin: moves are
 *    pseudo-legal and the game is won by capturing the enemy king.
 *
 *    The vision rule is chosen so that a fogged position is *informationally
 *    complete*: the moves generated from a player's fogged FEN are exactly the
 *    moves of the true position, so the server never has to ship hidden squares
 *    for a client to know what it may play. See `_visionSquares`.
 *
 * 5. `loadPgn()` and its generated peggy parser dependency were removed. PGN
 *    output is still supported.

/*
 * NOTES ABOUT 0x88 MOVE GENERATION ALGORITHM
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * From https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/issues/230
 *
 * A lot of people are confused when they first see the internal representation
 * of chess.js. It uses the 0x88 Move Generation Algorithm which internally
 * stores the board as an 8x16 array. This is purely for efficiency but has a
 * couple of interesting benefits:
 *
 * 1. 0x88 offers a very inexpensive "off the board" check. Bitwise AND (&) any
 *    square with 0x88, if the result is non-zero then the square is off the
 *    board. For example, assuming a knight square A8 (0 in 0x88 notation),
 *    there are 8 possible directions in which the knight can move. These
 *    directions are relative to the 8x16 board and are stored in the
 *    PIECE_OFFSETS map. One possible move is A8 - 18 (up one square, and two
 *    squares to the left - which is off the board). 0 - 18 = -18 & 0x88 = 0x88
 *    (because of two-complement representation of -18). The non-zero result
 *    means the square is off the board and the move is illegal. Take the
 *    opposite move (from A8 to C7), 0 + 18 = 18 & 0x88 = 0. A result of zero
 *    means the square is on the board.
 *
 * 2. The relative distance (or difference) between two squares on a 8x16 board
 *    is unique and can be used to inexpensively determine if a piece on a
 *    square can attack any other arbitrary square. For example, let's see if a
 *    pawn on E7 can attack E2. The difference between E7 (20) - E2 (100) is
 *    -80. We add 119 to make the ATTACKS array index non-negative (because the
 *    worst case difference is A8 - H1 = -119). The ATTACKS array contains a
 *    bitmask of pieces that can attack from that distance and direction.
 *    ATTACKS[-80 + 119=39] gives us 24 or 0b11000 in binary. Look at the
 *    PIECE_MASKS map to determine the mask for a given piece type. In our pawn
 *    example, we would check to see if 24 & 0x1 is non-zero, which it is
 *    not. So, naturally, a pawn on E7 can't attack a piece on E2. However, a
 *    rook can since 24 & 0x8 is non-zero. The only thing left to check is that
 *    there are no blocking pieces between E7 and E2. That's where the RAYS
 *    array comes in. It provides an offset (in this case 16) to add to E7 (20)
 *    to check for blocking pieces. E7 (20) + 16 = E6 (36) + 16 = E5 (52) etc.
